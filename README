Program 4

Known Design: the program is to recover the files (both deleted and undeleted) located on a FAT12 disk image and printing a summary of each file include name, directory name, path, and file size
	
Known Problem: for some of the deleted file recovery, my program will miss some bytes of the file due to unknown reason. Otherwise, the program does not have any known problem.
